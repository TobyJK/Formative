# What Went Well
- Consistent style
- Good evidence of research
- Footnotes are a nice touch

# Even Better If
- Photo credits, if they have free licences it is polite to mention
- Open links in a different page using target="_blank" in href tag
- Hard to read white text on light blue background and predominantly grey background photo
- Nav bar when small -> the "Nathan" does not line up with "Home"
- Stylesheets
    - Use external stylesheets
    - Move styles.css to css folder
- Move pages to a pages file
